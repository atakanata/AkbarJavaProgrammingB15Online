   Exception :

   	scan.nextInt() -->> expect number
   	if we pass String --->> execption at run time
   	str.charAt(100)  --->> execption at run time

   	String str2 = null
   	str2.charAt(0)  --->> execption at run time

   	int[] arr = {1,2,4} ;
   	print( arr[100]  ) -->> execption at run time
   String str = "a" ;

   	print(9/0) ;  -->> execption at run time



   	Shape a1 = new Circle();
   	Rectangle r1 = (Rectangle) a1 ;
   	// above code compile but Throw ClassCastException at run time
   	// Because Circle is NOT-A Rectangle


   	The process of dealing with the unexpected event is called
   	Exception Handling


   	All different types of exceptions have its own class
   	to be the blueprint for the exceptions object happen at run time

   	Throwable is the super class type of all the exceptions classes


   	Just like everything else :
   	Exceptions are object !!!!!!!

   	Exceptions in Java is categorized using Exception Hierarchy
   		try to recover from it
   		or report it
   		dignose it / debug

   	How do you handle exceptins :

   		try catch block

   		try{

   			// code that might throw an exception

   		}catch(Exception e){

   			// just like method parameter :
   			// Exception e  is a variable with type Exception
   			// when java throw exception at run time
   			// it will assign the exception object to variable e
   			// for example if StringIndexOutOfBoundException happen in try block
   			// it will do below
   			// Exception e = new StringIndexOutOfBoundException("some message here");
   			// if it's NullPointerException it will do below
   			// Exception e = new NullPointerException(...);

   			// since it's an object , we can call a method just like any other object
   			// getMessage is useful method from Exception class
   					// to get some more information about the exception object
   					// created at run time

   			// if the exception happen the flow of program will come here
   			// take action to recover or just report or notify

   		}
   		// some more code
   		// by handling the exception might occure during the program
   		// our program will not shut down abruptly
   		// we can end or continue the program gracefully.





   		or delcare it










   --- WHAT ABOUT COMPILER ERROR ????   NO ----
   THIS IS SYNTAX ERROR THAT DOES NOT LET YOUR CODE COMPILER





   Exception :
   	abnormal or non-typical event
   	to cause alteration of program flow

   Exceptions are object just like everything else in Java

   when exception occure in the program ,
   an specific type of exception object that contains information
   will be created according to what happen
   and thrown to runtime system

   9/0  --> 	this is what happen behind the scene
   	throw new ArithmeticException( some message)

   "abc".charAt(100) -->> this is what happen behind the scene
   	throw new StringIndexOutOfBoundsException(....)


   Since exceptions are object ,
   It has its own class to be the blue print for the exception obejct

   Exceptions are categorized by Inheritance relationship

    Exception Hierarchy :

    					Throwable

    		Error 					Exception


    						RuntimeException    Everything else


   RuntimeException is sub class of Exception class.
   Anything IS-A RuntimeException is regarded as Unchecked Exception
   We are not forced to handle the exception at compile time.
   Usually happen due incorrect usage of the method or library
   for example : passing incorrect index for charAt method


   Any Sub class of the Exception class other than RuntimeException
   	is regarded as Checked Exception
   	and We MUST (are forced to) handle or declare at compile time
   Most of the time File related actions are checked exception
   for example IOException , FileNotFoundException and so on


   Whats the easiest way if I do not want to google to know its checked of Unchecked
   just try to throw it using throw keyword
   if compiler complains it means its checked if not unchecked


   ------ Most importantly Someone has to handle the exception obejct that created
          during the program run.

          try catch
          try catch catch catch
          try catch .... finally

          try{

          		cliffDiving();
          		gettingTheSleepingKidFromTheCar();

          }catch(DiveTooDeepException e){

          		hang on to the wire , told you so

          }catch(CryingOutOfBoundException e){

          		You cry too , ignore , pick the kid up , try to calm down
          		rock him to sleep again

          }catch( Exception e  ){

          		if anything else happen , come here !!!!

          } finally {

          		// no matter exception happen or caught or not happen at all
          		// this is the place that always run

          }


    ----------------   throw VS throws --------------


   throws keyword is used to document a method might throw that type of exception


   public static void playWithFire throws GetBurnedException{
   	// some code here
   	// IS IT REQUIRED TO HAVE EXCEPTION OBJECT ACTUALLY GENERATED HERE??
   	// NO , IT MIGHT HAPPPEN OR IT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN
   }

   this is the only place you will see throws keywrod
   in (any) method declareation and is not used anywhere else.
   we will not use new keyword after throws

   Since throws are used to document it might throw an exception
   can i documemnt more than one type?

   // assuming these exceptions actually exists
   public void skyDiving() throws DiveTooDeepException, TooScareException,
   								ParachuteNotWorkingException {

   								}


   throw keyword
   Its used to actually programaitically throw the exception to the runtime system
   just like actually breaking the glass rather than telling it might break

   for example :  throw new AnyTypeOfException( optional message here) .

   	What can you throw ?????
   	ANYTHING IS-A Throwable ,
   	any object created from Throwable class or Sub class of Throwable class
   	even the Error (DO NOT TRY AT HOME!!!!!)





   ------ How to create custom Exception ? -----


How do you create your own unchecked exception type :

       BreakTimeException , BrainOutOfMemoryException

      What is unchecked exception > Anything IS-A RunTimeException

      so ALL YOU NEED IS TO CREATE A SUBCLASS OF RunTimeException WITH YOUR OWN NAME


      public class BreakTimeException extends RuntimeException(or any sub class of it) {


      }


How do you create your own checked exception type :

    ALL YOU NEED IS TO CREATE A SUBCLASS OF ANY CHECKED EXCEPTION WITH YOUR OWN NAME


    public class HittingHeadToWallException extends Exception (or any sub class of it) {


    }


// This is how we can create our own checked exception
public class MyOwnCheckedExeption extends Exception{


}
// This is how we can create our own unchecked exception
public class BreakTimeException extends RuntimeException{

}

You can treated just like any other exception type Java already provided



Common data processing in real life


Scenario 1 :
If I ask you tell me your state so I can store :
	first I did not care about duplicates
 I would just created a List and keep adding all your state into it


Scenario 2 :
 	then I realize there are many studenst from same states
 	and I want to only store the unique states you are from

so I need some kind of data structure already does it for me
so I dont have to use bunch of if statememts to handle it

	Set interface is a data structure for unique element

	if I wanted to keep the sorted order
		SortedSet



Scenario 3 :
	now I want to actually store the student-state pair
	so i can get the state by student name :
	Michael : Virginia

	Map interface
	if I wanted to keep the sorted order
		SortedMap


Scenario 4 :
	I want to answer the questions I got from the students
	but I want to answer them in the order I received
	so First come first serve based !!

	Queue




























    // First create a file by right clicking day60 package and select new -- File
    // name your file as note.txt 
    // enter few line of text 
    // close the file (it might ask you to save , if it did not it means it already saved)
    // then use 
    // List<String> allLines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get("src/day60/note.txt"));
    // the method declare to throw checked exception so HANDLE OR DECLARE  !! 
    // for reading the file and storing it into the list 
    // make sure the path is correct , if not , it will throw exception 
    // print out the list content using loop to see whats inside line by line
